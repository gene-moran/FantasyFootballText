    prompt = """Search X and the web thoroughly for the best fantasy football waiver wire 
pickups for the coming week of the 2025 NFL season. 

CRITICAL: Verify all player schedules, matchups, and injury reports before making recommendations. 
Double-check that the teams and opponents you mention are actually playing each other in the 
upcoming weeks. Do not hallucinate matchups.

Focus your X search on:
- Fantasy experts and analysts (e.g., @FantasyPros, @TheFFExperts, @YahooFantasy, 
  @ScottBarrettDFB, @JJZachariason)
- Recent tweets from beat reporters about player usage, injuries, and opportunities
- Fantasy community discussion about sleepers and breakout candidates
- Injury news that creates opportunities for backup players

Also search the web for:
- Latest waiver wire articles from FantasyPros, ESPN, Yahoo, The Athletic, CBS Sports
- VERIFIED NFL schedules and matchups for the next 2-3 weeks
- Player news, snap counts, and target share from last week
- Upcoming matchups and defensive rankings

Provide me with TOP 5 PICKUPS FOR EACH POSITION:
- 5 QBs
- 5 RBs
- 5 WRs
- 5 TEs
- 5 Kickers (K)
- 5 Defenses (D/ST)

For each player include:
- Ownership percentage (if available)
- Why they're valuable (injury replacement, favorable schedule, usage trending up, etc.)
- VERIFIED next 2-3 weeks opponent schedule with actual matchups

At the end, tell me which ONE player should be my #1 waiver priority overall.

Format your response for a PLAIN TEXT EMAIL - do not use markdown symbols like ###, **, or -. 
Instead use:
- ALL CAPS for section headers
- Blank lines between sections
- Simple dashes or numbers for lists

Prioritize players available in most leagues (under 50% rostered). Be accurate and verify all 
information before including it."""
